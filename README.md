My personal implementation of common algorithms in C++. This is mainly based on TopCoder tutorials. Topics covered: 
- Geometry Concepts: Basic concepts
- Geometry concepts: Line Intersection and Its applications
- Introduction to graphs and their data structures
- Fast Fourier Transform
- Graph algorithms (Dijkstra...)
- Dynamic Programming 
- Max flow, min cut

Also, there are solutions to several problems in TopCoder and Codeforces
